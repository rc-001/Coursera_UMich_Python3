#1. rainfall_mi is a string that contains the average number of inches of rainfall in Michigan for every month (in inches) 
#with every month separated by a comma. Write code to compute the number of months that have more than 3 inches of rainfall.

#3. Write code to count the number of strings in list items that have the character w in it.

#HINT 1: Use the accumulation pattern!

#HINT 2: the in operator checks whether a substring is present in a string.

#4. Write code that counts the number of words in sentence that contain either an “a” or an “e”. 
#Store the result in the variable num_a_or_e.

#Note 1: be sure to not double-count words that contain both an a and an e.

#HINT 1: Use the in operator.

#HINT 2: You can either use or or elif.

#6. Create one conditional so that if “Friendly” is in w, then “Friendly is here!” should be assigned to the variable wrd. 
#If it’s not, check if “Friend” is in w. If so, the string “Friend is here!” should be assigned to the variable wrd,

#8. Write code so that if "STATS 250" is in the list schedule, then the string "You could be in Information Science!" 
#3is assigned to the variable resp. Otherwise, the string "That's too bad." should be assigned to the variable resp.

#9. Create the variable z whose value is 30. Write code to see if z is greater than y. 
#If so, add 5 to y’s value, otherwise do nothing. Then, multiply z and y, and assign the resulting value to the variable x.

#10. For each string in wrd_lst, find the number of characters in the string.
