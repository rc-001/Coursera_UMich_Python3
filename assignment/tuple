#2. Create a tuple called practice that has four elements: ‘y’, ‘h’, ‘z’, and ‘x’.
practice = "y", "h", "z", "x"


#3. Create a tuple named tup1 that has three elements: ‘a’, ‘b’, and ‘c’.
tup1 = "a", "b", "c"


#4. Provided is a list of tuples. Create another list called t_check that contains the third element of every tuple.
lst_tups = [('Articuno', 'Moltres', 'Zaptos'), ('Beedrill', 'Metapod', 'Charizard', 'Venasaur', 'Squirtle'), ('Oddish', 'Poliwag', 'Diglett', 'Bellsprout'), ('Ponyta', "Farfetch'd", "Tauros", 'Dragonite'), ('Hoothoot', 'Chikorita', 'Lanturn', 'Flaaffy', 'Unown', 'Teddiursa', 'Phanpy'), ('Loudred', 'Volbeat', 'Wailord', 'Seviper', 'Sealeo')]
t_check = [i[2] for i in lst_tups]
print(t_check)


#5. Below, we have provided a list of tuples. Write a for loop that saves the second element of each tuple into a list called seconds.
tups = [('a', 'b', 'c'), (8, 7, 6, 5), ('blue', 'green', 'yellow', 'orange', 'red'), (5.6, 9.99, 2.5, 8.2), ('squirrel', 'chipmunk')]
seconds = [i[1] for i in tups]
print(seconds)

#6. Define a function called information that takes as input, the variables name, birth_year, fav_color, and hometown. It should return a tuple of these variables in this order.

def information(name, birth_year, fav_color, hometown):
    return (name, birth_year, fav_color, hometown)
    
#7. Define a function called info with the following required parameters: name, age, birth_year, year_in_college, and hometown. The function should return a tuple that contains all the inputted information.

def info(name, age, birth_year, year_in_college, hometown):
    return (name, age, birth_year, year_in_college, hometown)
