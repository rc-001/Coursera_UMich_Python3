#8. Write a function named same that takes a string as input, and simply returns that string.
def same(x):
    return x
    
#9. Write a function called same_thing that returns the parameter, unchanged.
def same_thing(x): 
    return x
    
#10. Write a function called subtract_three that takes an integer or any number as input, and returns that number minus three.
def subtract_three(x):
    return(x - 3)

#11. 11. Write a function called change that takes one number as its input and returns that number, plus 7.
def change(x): 
    return(x + 7)
 
#12. 12. Write a function named intro that takes a string as input. Given the string “Becky” as input, the function should return: “Hello, my name is Becky and I love SI 106.”
def intro(x): 
    return("Hello, my name is " + x + " and I love SI 106.")

#13. 13. Write a function called s_change that takes one string as input and returns that string, concatenated with the string ” for fun.”.
def s_change(x): 
    return(x + " for fun.")

#14. Write a function called decision that takes a string as input, and then checks the number of characters. If it has over 17 characters, return “This is a long string”, if it is shorter or has 17 characters, return “This is a short string”.
def decision(x):
    if len(x) > 17:
        return ("This is a long string")
    else: 
        return("This is a short string")
        
#1. Write a function named total that takes a list of integers as input, and returns the total value of all those integers added together.

def total(x): 
    sum = 0
    for num in x: 
        sum =  sum + num
    return sum
y = total([1, 5, 7])
print(y)

#2. Write a function called count that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a count of the number of elements in the list.
def count(x): 
    return len(x)


#12.10 1. Write two functions, one called addit and one called mult. addit takes one number as an input and adds 5. mult takes one number as an input, and multiplies that input by whatever is returned by addit, and then returns the result.

def addit(x):
    s = x + 5
    return s
def mult(y):
    b = y * addit(y)
    return b
