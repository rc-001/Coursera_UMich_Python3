#1. Write a while loop that is initialized at 0 and stops at 15. If the counter is an even number, append the counter to a list called eve_nums.

count = 0        
eve_nums = []
while count <= 15:
    if count % 2 == 0:
        eve_nums.append(count)
    count = count + 1

#2. Below, weâ€™ve provided a for loop that sums all the elements of list1. Write code that accomplishes the same task, but instead uses a while loop. Assign the accumulator variable to the name accum.

list1 = [8, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9]
tot = 0
for elem in list1:
    tot = tot + elem
    
idx = 0
accum = 0 
while idx < len(list1):
    accum = accum + list1[idx]
    idx = idx +1

#3. Write a function called stop_at_four that iterates through a list of numbers. Using a while loop, append each number to a new list until the number 4 appears. The function should return the new list.

def stop_at_four(my_list):
    accum_lst=[]
    accum_var=0

    while (accum_var < len(my_list)) and (my_list[accum_var] != 4):
        accum_lst.append(my_list[accum_var])
        accum_var+=1
    return accum_lst

print(stop_at_four([3,6,4,1,3]))
