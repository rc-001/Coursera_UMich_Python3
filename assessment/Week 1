#1. The textfile, travel_plans.txt, contains the summer travel plans for someone with some commentary. Find the total number of characters in the file and save to the variable num.

file = open("travel_plans.txt", "r")
data = file.read()
num = len(data)
file.close()


#2. We have provided a file called emotion_words.txt that contains lines of words that describe emotions. Find the total number of words in the file and assign this value to the variable num_words.

file = open("emotion_words.txt", 'r')
num_words = 0
for line in file:
        num_words += len(line.split())
        print(line.split())
print("number of words : ", num_words) 


#3. Assign to the variable num_lines the number of lines in the file school_prompt.txt.

file = open ("school_prompt.txt", "r")
count = file.readlines()
num_lines = len(count)
file.close()


#4. Assign the first 30 characters of school_prompt.txt as a string to the variable beginning_chars.

file = open ("school_prompt.txt", "r")
count = file.read()
beginning_chars = count[:30]
file.close()


#5. Challenge: Using the file school_prompt.txt, assign the third word of every line to a list called three.

three = []
with open('school_prompt.txt', 'r') as f:
    three = [line.split()[2] for line in f]
    print(three)
    
    
#6. Challenge: Create a list called emotions that contains the first word of every line in emotion_words.txt.

emotions = []
with open("emotion_words.txt", "r") as file:
    for words in file:
        word = words.split()
        emotions.append(word[0])
print(emotions)


#7. Assign the first 33 characters from the textfile, travel_plans.txt to the variable first_chars.

file = open ("travel_plans.txt", "r")
count = file.read()
first_chars = count[:33]
file.close()


#8. Challenge: Using the file school_prompt.txt, if the character ‘p’ is in a word, then add the word to a list called p_words.


fileref = open('school_prompt.txt', 'r')
words = fileref.read().split()
p_words = [word for word in words if 'p' in word]
print(p_words)
