#Create a class called Bike that contains two instance variables, color and price. Assign to the variable testOne, 
#an instance of Bike whose color is blue and price is 89.99. Assign to the variable testTwo, 
#an instance of Bike whose color is purple and price is 25.

class Bike:
    def __init__(self, c, p): 
        self.color = c 
        self.price = p
testOne = Bike("blue", 89.99)
testTwo = Bike("purple", 25.0)


1.1 Create a class called inst_var that defines two instance variables: num1 and num2. 
#Then, create an instance where num1 is 6 and num2 is 10 and save this instance to the variable t.

class int_var:
    def __init__(self, c, p): 
        self.num1 = c 
        self.num2 = p
t = int_var(6, 10)
print(t.num1)
print(t.num2)

1.2 Create a class called House that has three instance variables: color, rooms, and price. To the variable name houseOne, 
#assign an instance of House whose color is white, has 3 rooms, and costs 50000. 
#To the variable name houseTwo, assign an instance of House whose color is red, has 9 rooms, and costs 1000000.

class House: 
    def __init__(self, c, r, p): 
        self.color = c
        self.rooms = r
        self.price = p
houseOne = House("white", 3, 50000)
houseTwo = House("red", 9, 1000000)





#2.2 Create a class called Animal that has two instance variables: arms and legs. 
#Create a class method called limbs that, when called, returns the total number of limbs the animal has. 
#To the variable name spider, assign an instance of Animal that has 4 arms and 4 legs. 
#Call the limbs method on spider and save the result to the variable name spidlimbs.

class Animal: 
    
    def __init__(self, a, l):
        
        self.arms = a 
        self.legs = l

        return self.arms + self.legs

spider =  Animal(4, 4)
spidlimbs = spider.limbs()
print(spidlimbs)
        

#3. Create a class called bank that contains two instance variables, name and amt. 
#Add the instance method that allows you to customize the message returned when you print the instance 
#so that it says “Your account, [name goes here], has [start_amt goes here] dollars.” 
#Create an instance of this class with “Bob” as the name and 100 as the amount. 
#Save this to the variable t1.

class bank: 
    def __init__(self, n, a):
        self.name = n
        self.amt = a
    def __str__(self):

t1 = bank("Bob", 100)
print(t1)



#3.1 3.1 Create a class called Sports that contains 2 instance variables, name and number_of_players. 
#Add the instance method that allows you to customize the message returned when you print the 
#instance so that it says “The name of this sport is [name goes here] and [number_of_players goes here] 
#people create one team!” Create two instances of the class, one assigned to the 
#variable football_info and one called quidditch_info. The first uses football as the name and has 11 players, 
#the second uses quidditch as the name and has 7 players.


class Sports:
    def __init__(self, na, np):
        self.name = na
        self.number_of_players = np
    def __str__(self):

football_info = Sports("football", 11)
quidditch_info = Sports("quidditch", 7)


#3.2 Create a class called Cereal that has three instance variables: name, brand, and fiber. 
#When an instance of Cereal is printed, the user should see the following: “[name] 
#cereal is produced by [brand] and has [fiber] grams of fiber in every serving!” 
#To the variable name c1, assign an instance of Cereal whose name is Corn Flakes, brand is Kellogg’s, and fiber is 2. 
#To the variable name c2, assign an instance of Cereal whose name is Honey Nut Cheerios, brand is General Mills, 
#and fiber is 3. Practice printing both!


class Cereal: 
    def __init__(self, n, b, f): 
        self.name = n
        self.brand = b
        self.fiber = f
    def __str__(self): 
        return  "{} cereal is produced by {} and has {} grams of fiber in every serving!".format(self.name, self.brand, self.fiber)
